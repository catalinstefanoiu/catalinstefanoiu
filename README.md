## 👋 Hi, I’m Cătălin Ștefănoiu
👀 I specialize in Next.js and Angular development, with a strong foundation in front-end engineering and hands-on experience in Node.js for backend solutions.
🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my expertise in advanced web development and infrastructure, focusing on JavaScript, Angular, and cloud services like Azure and Terraform.
💼 I have experience working on diverse projects, including a Next.js invoice application, an Airbnb experiences site, and a natural disaster management platform, where I've contributed to robust, user-centric solutions.
💡 My interests also extend to backend technologies, microservices, and infrastructure automation with Terraform, as well as exploring Kafka for scalable systems.
💞️ Open to collaborations on projects involving Next.js, Angular, backend development, and cloud technologies like Azure.
